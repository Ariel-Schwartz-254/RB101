The code will output all elements in the `numbers` array, each on a seperate line. `1, 2, 2, 3`. In `line 2` we call the `uniq` method on `numbers`, which is not a destructive method and therefore `numbers` remains unchanged. This is why when we call `puts numbers` in `line 4`, this references the original array initialized on `line 1`.
