The `limit` variable is initialized on `line 1` outside the method definition. In order for the `limit` variable to be accessible inside the method, it would need to be passed into the method as an argument. Since `first_num` and `second_num` are the only arguments passed into the `fib` method, `limit` is not avaliable in the inner scope of the method. This demonstrates variable scoping rules in ruby, specifically that method definitions have their own self contained scope, and the only way outside variables can be accessed from within the method is by passing them into the method as arguments.
