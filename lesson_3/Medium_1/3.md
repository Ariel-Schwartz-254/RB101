You can use the `loop` method instead on `line 4`. I would also put the `break` statement right before the inner line of the loop on `lines 5 and 6`. The `break` statement would be: 

```ruby
break if divisor <= 0
```

This would now cover instances where the input is `0` or a negative number, since we would immediatey break out of the loop and `factors` would be an empty array.

the `number % divisor == 0` conditional expression checks if a number is evenly divisible by a divisor. this wold in turn determine if we should add this divisor's element into our `factors` array.

In Ruby, if no explicit `return` statement is given, a method implicitely returns the last evaluated expression. without `factors` on `line 8`, the last evaluated expression would be breaking out of the loop which has a return value of `nil`, this in turn would be the return value of the method.
