The code will output `34`. The `answer` variable initialized on `line 1` remains unchanged throughout the program. Including when it was passed into the `mess_with_it` method aliased as `some_number` as a method parameter. This is because the `some_number += 8` expression on `line 4` is reassignment, which does not mutate the method parameter `some_number`.
