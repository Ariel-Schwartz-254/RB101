The family's data got ransacked. The `munsters` hash was passed into the `mess_with_demographics` method and is accessible through the method parameter `demo_hash`. on `lines 11 and 12` the values within the hash are altered using `[ ] +=` and `[ ] =` which are setter methods, and setter methods are destructive and mutate the original object.
