You are attempting to concatenate a string with an integer which will throw an error. One way to fix this would be by using string interpolation like this: `puts "the value of 40 + 20 is #{40 + 2}"`. Another way is by converting `(40 + 2)` to a string by calling the `to_s` method on it, which would then allow us to concatenate the two parts of the sentance.
