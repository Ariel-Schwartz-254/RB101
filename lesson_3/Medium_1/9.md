The `bar` method is invoked and the `foo` method is passed into it as an argument. Ruby will first invoke the `foo` method and the return value will then be used as the parameter in the `bar` method. The `foo` method returns `"yes"` and is passed into the `bar` method. The ternary expression on `line 6` will evaluate to `"no"` since the `param == "no"` evaluates to `false`. And so the return value of the `bar(foo)` method invocation will be `"no"`.
