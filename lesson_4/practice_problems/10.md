The return value of the code is `[1,nil,nil]`.

`map` returns a new array containing the same amount of elements as in the original array. These new elements consist of the return value of the last expression of the block.

During the first iteration, the `if` expression returns `num` since `1` is not bigger than 1 and we move to the `else` branch. On the next two iterations, `2` and `3` are bigger than 1 and we will output both those numbers. The `if` expression returns `nil` during these iterations because the return value of the last expression (`puts num`) is `nil`.
