The return value is `11`. When chaining methods, we evaluate from left to right. First, we call `pop` on `['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar']` which destructively removes the last element of the array, and returns that element. We then call `size` on that return value by `pop`, `'caterpillar'`, which returns `11` whcih is the size of the string.
