The return value of the `select` method will be `[1,2,3]`. This is because `select` uses the return value of the block to determine if an element should be selected. Specifically, an element will be selected if the block returns a truthy value during that iteration. A block's return value is the last evaluated expression. The last evaluated expression in this block is `'hi'` which is a truthy value, therefore the block will return a truthy value during each iteration, selecting each element in the original array. `select` will return a new array containing all the elements in the original array.
