The blocks return value is determined by the return value of the last expression `num.odd?`. During each iteration, `line 3` calls `odd?` on the block parameter `num`, which returns `true` if a number is odd, and `false` if a number is even. `any?` will return `true` if the block ever returns `true`. Since the block will return `true` immediately when `1` is passed in as the block parameter, `any?` will stop iterating and return `true`. Since the block is only executd once, the code will only output: `1` (from the `puts` statement on `line 2`).
