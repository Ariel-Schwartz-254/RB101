The return value is `[nil, 'bear']`. 
`map` returns a new array containing the same number of elements in the original hash. Each element in the new array will be the return value of the last expression in the block.

When the first key value pair, `a: 'ant'`, is passed into the block, the conditional on `line 2` evaluates to `false`. Since there are no other branches in the conditional, the `if` expression returns `nil`. Since the `if` expression is the last expression of the block, its return value will be added to the new array.

When the second key value pair, `b: 'bear'`, is passed into the block, the conditional on `line 2` evaluates to `true`. The `if` expression returns `'bear'`, which is `value` during this iteration.
