The return value is `{'a' => 'ant', 'b' => 'bear', 'c' => 'cat'}`.
`each_with_object` returns the new object it created, in our case a hash. During iteration, we added key value pairs to this hash using the setter method on `line 2`. We select that first char  in `value` as the keys in the new hash, and the values are the entire string `value`.
